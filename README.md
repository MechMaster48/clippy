# clippy

-Clippy is a small project that will take text (usually from some sort of webpage or other document) and pull out the emails and phone numbers and place it into your clipboard

-This is meant to be just a learning project that was pulled from Automate the boring stuff with python to help me get more familiar with using regular expressions

# Example
